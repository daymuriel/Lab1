       <h1>things that <em>dayanna</em> genuinely cares about:</h1> 
       <p>so i'd call myself an enthusiast of several things...</p>
       <ol>
           <li><h2>i'm a sonic enthusiast</h2>
               <img src= "images/sonic1.jpg"
                alt = "a very cool, tiny dog wearing sun shades">
               <p>this is my dog, sonic. he's almost 2 and as you can see, there's a striking resemblance between our swag</p>
           </li>
           <li><h2>i'm an ella enthusiast</h2>
               <img src= "images/ella.jpg"
                alt = "two girls taking a mirror selfies in their school bathroom">
               <p>this is ella, my best friend. she's 15 and as you can see, there's a striking resemblance between our very obnoxious and annoying personalities</p>
           </li>
           <li><h2>i'm a pitbull enthusiast</h2>
                <a href = "https://pitbullmusic.com">
               <img src= "images/pitbullshrine.jpg"
                alt = "a pitbull shrine consisting of various pictures of pitbull, as well as a handmade pitbull mug and a portrait of pitbull as god">
                </a>
               <p>this is pitbull, or mr. worldwide, or mr. 305, or <strong>the love of my life</strong>. i've hand crafted a mini shrine of him to show my dedication and loyalty to him.</p>
